Electric Vehicles have BMS - Battery Management Systems

[Here is an article that helps to understand the need for BMS](https://circuitdigest.com/article/battery-management-system-bms-for-electric-vehicles)

[Wikipedia gives an idea of the types and topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system)

[This site gives the optimum Charging-temperature limits](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_at_high_and_low_temperatures)

[This abstract suggests a range for the optimum State of Charge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484719310911)

[Here is a reference for the maximum charge rate](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/battery-technology/li-ion-lithium-ion-charging.php#:~:text=Constant%20current%20charge:%20In%20the%20first%20stage%20of,rate%20of%20a%20maximum%20of%200.8C%20is%20recommended.)

## purpose

- Protect batteries while charging:
at home, in public place, within vehicle / regenerative braking
- Estimate life, inventory and supply chains

## Implemented functionalities
1. Battery Health check
2. Extensions
    - Battery health check based on tolerance
    - Battery health report in English and German
    - Use BatterManagementProperties.java to change Language and tolerance
